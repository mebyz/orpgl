; Tiles to Files, V1.0
;
; http://flickr.com/photos/theilr, (c) 2009
;
; DESCRIPTION: Partitions an image into tiles (with, optionally,
; either gaps or overlaps between them) and writes each tile as a
; separate jpeg file.  Note, this is almost identical to the
; Image->Transform->Guillotine function
;
; ONE MOTIVATION: At winkflash today, you can buy 4x6 inch prints for
; six cents each; so you could buy 36 of them for $2.16, and tile an
; area of size 24x36 inches.  But to buy a single 24x36 inch print
; will cost about $20.  Of course, the two aren't exactly equivalent,
; but what this script provides is a quick way to produce the separate
; jpeg files.
;
; USAGE NOTES: 
; As well as generating the files, it (by default) also makes
; an auxiliary image in a new window where each tile is a separate
; layer.  You can have that image deleted before you ever see it, but
; it might be useful if you want to check that the tiles are
; reasonable, or if you want to do some further processing to the
; individual tiles.  Otherwise, you'll probably want to close that
; image, when you are sure that the jpegs are what you wanted.
;
; If you give a blank filename, then files are not generated. 
;
; The tiles will always be the same size (this is not a bug) even if that
; means that a few pixels are dropped off the right or bottom margins.
; (By contrast, depending on how you do it, setting up guides and using 
; Guillotine, will get all the pixels, but some images will be slightly
; different sizes.)
;  
; BUGS: 
;
; This is almost identical to a setting up of regular guides, followed
; by the Image->Transform->Guillotine function.  eg, see
;
; http://registry.gimp.org/node/12003
; http://registry.gimp.org/node/20826
;
; The individual jpeg files lose the EXIF info from the original file.
; (I don't really understand all the parameters to file-jpeg-save; and
; I also remark that the Guillotine approach doesn't have this problem.)
;
; That the output can only be jpeg is probably a bug; the user might
; prefer other file formats, or (at the least) to be able to adjust
; the jpeg quality parameter.
;
; If you give a blank filename AND you check the toggle to delete the
; image of tiles, then this script will do a lot of work and not have 
; anything to show for it!
; 
; It might be better to do this in two steps. First generate the image
; of tiles.  Then (if you are happy with them) generate the files.  A
; separate routine that did layers-to-files might be useful in its own
; right.  
;
; Only works on RGB images; should probably extend to GRAYSCALE, etc.
;
; I've limited this to 100x100 tiles.  It's an arbitrary limit, but
; I'd think it should be plenty.  
;
; The number of overlap/gao pixels is limited to 200, again arbitrary
; and capricious.  Also, the number is the same for horizontal and
; vertical.  I can see where a percentage might be preferable.
;
; Negative overlap may not be the most intuitive way to make gaps.
;
; It might be cool to have an option to add some kind of border to
; all of the images.
;
; Height and Horizontal both start with the letter H; that's not my
; fault, but it can lead to ambiguities with abbreviations.
;
; TESTING:
; This script was tested with GIMP 2.6.7
